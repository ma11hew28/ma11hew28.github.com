  <p>I'm seriously considering moving to Puerto Rico, so I'm looking for a personal assistant to assist me in moving from my apartment (in Norwalk, Connecticut) to Puerto Rico.</p>
  <p>Ideally, I'd like to complete the move on or before July 1, 2021, in order to qualify for certain tax incentives, my main reason for moving, but I may want to move out as early as May 31.</p>
  <p>However, I still have a lot of things to do, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Move out of my current apartment.
      <ul>
        <li>Buy a suitcase and some masks.</li>
        <li>Sell my desk, massage table, toaster oven, etc.</li>
        <li>Declutter, organize, pack, etc.</li>
        <li>Scan important documents.</li>
        <li>Book flights, lodging, rides to & from airports, etc.</li>
        <li>Cancel my voter registration in Connecticut (and in Norwalk).</li>
        <li>Cancel my gym membership.</li>
        <li>Close my savings account.</li>
        <li>Get a cell phone plan.</li>
        <li>Hire a move-out cleaning service.</li>
        <li>Ship my car and some of my personal items to Puerto Rico.</li>
        <li>Cancel my car's Connecticut registration and license plates.</li>
        <li>Cancel my utilities: internet, gas, and electric.</li>
        <li>Do a move-out inspection with a property manager.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Move to a place in Puerto Rico.
      <ul>
        <li>Find a place to live (probably a rental or a room).</li>
        <li>Get a Puerto Rico driver license (and cancel my CT one).</li>
        <li>Register my car in Puerto Rico.</li>
        <li>Register to vote in Puerto Rico.</li>
        <li>Update my car insurance for Puerto Rico.</li>
        <li>Change my address with USPS, my bank, etc.</li>
        <li>Get a tax exemption decree.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Self-care: Grocery shop, prepare food, clean, do laundry, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And that's an incomplete list.</p>
  <p> I feel overwhelmed because I realize I have so much to do and so little time, and I'm often unproductive and rarely hit deadlines, as I tend to be perfectionistic, so I tend to procrastinate and get distracted easily.</p>
  <p>Working together with someone tends to help me stay focused, and together we tend to get more done faster.</p>
  <p>It's OK if you don't have experience doing everything on this list. Neither do I. Even if all we did together was get rid of lots of my stuff, that'd be a huge weight off my shoulders, no pun intended.</p>
  <p>I'm generally available to work every day (including weekends) between the hours of 9 AM EDT and 7 PM EDT.</p>
  <p>Some of the work could be done remotely, over Skype, but we could do all of it at my apartment in Norwalk.</p>
  <p>Unless you're only interested in working together remotely, I'd prefer you to be a fresh-air breather (non-smoker) because I'm super health-conscious and would rather not be exposed to third-hand smoke.</p>
  <p>If we decide to work together, I'd prefer us to schedule times to work together during which we're both completely free (of any distractions and interruptions). While we're working together, let's stay focused, minimize distractions and interruptions, and keep our phones off (or on Do Not Disturb). During breaks, we could check our missed calls, messages, emails, etc. We may get sidetracked from time to time, eg, by discussing something off-topic, and that's OK, but let's be good about getting back on track, staying focused, and being productive.</p>
  <p>I'd prefer to hire you as an independent contractor (not an employee) and pay you via PayPal immediately after each session.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in helping me move to Puerto Rico, feel free <a href="/contact">contact me</a> by email. We could set up a brief interview over the phone, over Skype, or in person.</p>
