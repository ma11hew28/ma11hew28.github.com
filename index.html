      <p>This website is just a start... It's still missing a lot.</p>
      <p>Currently, Iâ€™m going to school for massage therapy part-time and working on an iPhone app with a friend part-time.</p>
      <p>I like to go for walks and runs, eat healthily, play soccer and hockey, lift, do yoga, meditate, journal, and read.</p>
      <p>I recently listened to an auidobook on <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/1491518839">How to Create a Mind</a></em> by Ray Kurzweil. I'm currently listening to another auidobook on <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens</a></em> by Yuval Noah Harari. Both books are so enlightening!</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/-pEhC3345JE">Self-Reliance</a>" by Ralph Waldo Emerson really speaks to me, and I also like the <em><a href="https://youtu.be/UxEvRoAaYBM">Tao Te Ching</a></em> by Laozi.</p>
      <p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Way-Peaceful-Warrior-Changes-Lives/dp/1932073205">Way of the Peaceful Warrior</a></em> by Dan Millman, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Gift-Andy-Andrews/dp/0785273220">The Traveler's Gift</a></em> by Andy Andrews, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Novel-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845">Siddhartha</a></em> by Hermann Hesse all share a lot of wisdom.</p>
      <p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Original-Unedited/dp/193764135X">Think and Grow Rich</a></em> by Napoleon Hill and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></em> are both classics.</p>
      <p>I like to watch <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE">The Joe Rogan Experience</a></em>. I also like to watch <em><a href="https://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor">The Bachelor</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.usanetwork.com/temptationisland">Temptation Island</a></em>.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to contact me, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:Matthew Di Pasquale <liveloveprosper@gmail.com>">liveloveprosper@gmail.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Enjoy. :-)</p>
