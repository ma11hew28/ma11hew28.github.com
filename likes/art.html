    <li><em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> by Johannes Vermeer - added Sun Nov  8 10:35:34 EST 2020 - I was watching Genius: Picasso S2E7, and at around 6:05 Picasso tells Eva Gouel "You belong in a Vermeer." I went back ten seconds, turned on the captions to see that he said "Vermeer" (because I didn't understand that part), and then I paused it and googled Vermer. Then I saw this painting amoung the images, and I recognized it, and I realized how beautiful it is, and how pretty the girl is in the painting.</li>
