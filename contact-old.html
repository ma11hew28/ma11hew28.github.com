  <p>Here's a list of my old emails and phone numbers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dipasqualem@kent-school.edu</li>
    <li>pasquale@fas.harvard.edu</li>
    <li>+1.617-894-0859</li>
    <li>+1.830-448-3255</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They're no longer mine, but I've included them in case you're trying to look me up by one of them. (To see my current email address and phone number, go to <a href="/contact">Contact</a>.)</p>
  <p>The two email addresses were my school email addresses each of which I used when I was a student and lost access to after graduating. My Harvard alumni email forwarding address is pasquale@post.harvard.edu. That email address works—It just forwards emails to liveloveprosper@gmail.com—but I'd prefer you to just send all emails directly to liveloveprosper@gmail.com.</p>
  <p>I wish I had kept my old 617 phone number, but for some reason, which I don't remember, I selected a new 203 phone number (my current number) when I switched from my Verizon plan to my friend's AT&T plan, which I think I did sometime around January 1, 2015.</p>
  <p>On November 20, 2018, I ported my number to Google Voice (for a fee of $20). Google Voice is free, and I could still make and receive calls and send and receive texts but only over the Internet, and since I didn't have a data plan, I typically couldn't connect to the Internet when I wasn't at home. Also, if you wanted to send me anything other than text (eg, photos, videos, or vCards), then you had to use iMessage or email them to me because I think photos and videos I received over MMS underwent lossy compression: Videos usually appeared very blurry, and I couldn't even open or download vCards. At one point, I decided to turn off iMessage and FaceTime so that all my texts went through Google Voice. But I started to miss iMessage & FaceTime, so I turned them back on, but then I couldn't get my phone number working with iMessage and FaceTime again. So if you wanted to send me an iMessage or FaceTime me, you had to use my email address.</p>
  <p>On July 4, 2020, I ported my number to Ting. But I found Ting's pay-per-use rates confusing—However, I asked them to retroactively apply an introductory credit to my account, and they were nice enough to do that, which saved me some money—and with Ting I was able to get my phone number working again with iMessage & FaceTime, so on July 6, 2020, I ported my number back to Google Voice (for a fee of $20). But at some point (I think about a month later) my phone number automatically stopped working with iMessage & FaceTime.</p>
  <p>On February 5, 2021, I ported my number to Red Pocket, but I still had an iPhone 6, and Red Pocket had dropped support for visual voicemail for iPhone models older than iPhone 6S. So on March 8, 2021, I ported my number back to Google Voice (for a fee of $20). Red Pocket was nice enough to refund me for my second month of service (when I called and asked them to) since I didn't use any of it.</p>
  <p>On June 13, 2021, two days before my trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, I bought an iPhone 12 mini. The next day, I set it up and ported my number to Ting. (Having a cell phone plan makes travelling a lot easier.) I have Ting's Flex plan, and I like it so far, but I also find the Flex rates confusing, albeit economical. (My personal referral link is <a href="https://zaofj6a9lp21.ting.com/" target="_blank">https://zaofj6a9lp21.ting.com/</a>. If you use it to try Ting, Ting will give us each a $25 credit.) I think I'll keep Ting for now. I like having cell phone service when I need it even though I don't typically use my phone that much, and I'm glad that now my phone number will continue to work with iMessage & FaceTime.</p>
  <p>The 830 phone number was my first Google Voice number. I think I could've kept it for an extra $20, but I just let it go (after porting my 203 number to Google Voice) because I barely used it.</p>
