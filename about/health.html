  <h2>General</h2>
  <p>I feel healthy, but I haven't had a physical for many years. Getting a physical is something I've been putting off. It's on my to-do list. I've lost a good amount of hair on the top of my head, and my hairline has receded. I don’t regularly take any medications. I allow for natural healing whenever possible. In 2017 I got tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and all the results came back negative. I have natural foreskin.</p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>I was born with healthy eyes and eyesight. I have full color vision. I used to have 20/20 vision, but I began developing myopia (nearsightedness) around the age of 9 and was prescribed corrective lenses. I wore them all the time except during sleeping. I started with glasses, but soon after I switched to wearing contact lenses. I remember going back to my ophthalmologist every year, and I think every year he'd give me a stronger prescription. I think the strongest prescription I reached was about -5.00 diopters in each eye. In 2006 I learned about natural vision improvement and stopped wearing contacts. I like to let my eyes breath and relax. Now I only wear my glasses when I need them, such as for driving. I last got my eyes checked on April 3, 2019. My optometrist said that my eyes were healthy and gave me a glasses prescription, which I think was -3.50 diopters in my left eye and -3.00 diopters with some astigmatism in my right eye.</p>

  <h2>Hearing</h2>
  <p>I remember getting a hearing screening (which I passed) in grade school maybe when I was in kindergarten. I don't remember the last time I got my hearing checked, but I think I still have good hearing. However, sometimes I have trouble understanding speech in films and tv, and sometimes I notice the subtitles are incorrect. I guess I can relate to this question: <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/2056/why-are-movies-so-hard-to-understand-and-what-can-you-do-about-it" target="_blank">Why are movies so hard to understand (and what can you do about it)?</a> I'm sensitive to loud noises, and I often protect my hearing, eg, by watching movies on low volume, wearing earplugs at concerts, etc.</p>

  <h2>Dental</h2>
  <p>My first and second set of teeth both grew in straight, but I sucked my thumb for a while when I was a kid, so I got spaces between my upper front teeth. In middle school, I got braces to close those spaces. I wore a retainer for a few years after getting my braces off but don't wear one anymore. When I was about 28 years old, I had two cavities (each in one of my molars) filled.</p>

  <h2>Family history</h2>
  <p>My mother's mother died at the age of 66 after three years of breast cancer. My mother’s father died at the age of 80 of heart disease. My mother had one brother. He was intellectually disabled and died in his late 70s. My mother's parents were cousins. Their mothers were sisters.</p>
  <p>My father died at the age of 51 of heart disease. My father’s mother died in her 80s of heart disease. My father’s father died in his late 70s of heart disease. My father had one sister. She died at the age of 7 of Wilms tumor.</p>
