  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p>I aim to eat a nutritarian diet, but I haven’t been eating a big salad every day. I tend to eat a whole-foods, plant-rich diet. I sometimes (when I remember) take the following supplements, which collectively include vitamins, minerals, superfoods, and omega oils: <a href="https://shop.drfuhrman.com/mens-daily/" target="_blank">Dr. Fuhrman Men's Daily</a> (multivitamin), <a href="https://shop.drfuhrman.com/immune-biotect/" target="_blank">Dr. Fuhrman Immune Biotect</a>, and <a href="https://www.florahealth.com/us/products/udos-choice-dha-oil-blend/" target="_blank">Udo’s Oil™ DHA 3•6•9 Blend</a>.</p>

  <h2>Sleep</h2>
  <p>I aim to go to bed every night at 9:30 PM, but I’ve typically been going to bed around 11 PM. I usually wake up naturally, without using an alarm clock. Sometimes I meditate.</p>

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>I aim to exercise (for at least 30 minutes) every day, but I’ve typically been exercising one to three times per week. I’ve been going for walks almost every day and doing yoga and strength training about twice a week on average.</p>

  <h2>Drink</h2>
  <p>I don’t drink anymore. Until November 2017 I used to drink socially, usually one or sometimes two beers when I was out at a party or a bar or whatever.</p>

  <h2>Smoke</h2>
  <p>I don’t smoke. I inhaled a cigarette once (in 2013) and coughed a lot and haven’t done it since. I don’t plan on doing it again. I don't vape either. I prefer to breath fresh air.</p>

  <h2>Drugs</h2>
  <p>I don’t do drugs. I’ve done cannabis about seven times in my life. (I've smoked it and have eaten edibles.) The last time I did it was in January of 2020. I don’t plan on doing it again, but I'm not making any promises.</p>
