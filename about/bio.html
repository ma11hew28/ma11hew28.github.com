  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>My mom & dad met in medical school at the University of Bologna. I was born in Alabama when they were both 42. A year later we moved to Westport, Connecticut, where I attended the public school system.</p>
  <p>I'm the youngest of five children. I have two brothers and two sisters. Two are doctors, one is a lawyer, and the other is a tech entrepreneur. The oldest one is 15 years older than me. The oldest three are married with children.</p>
  <p>When I was a kid, my dad coached my soccer and ice hockey teams and took me biking, fishing, and skiing. My mom got me piano, chess, and golf lessons and sent me to skateboard camp. My parents took us to plays, musicals, operas, and museums and even on vacations overseas.</p>
  <p>One day when I was nine, we were on our way to Nantucket during our summer vacation in Cape Cod. Suddenly my dad had a heart attack and died.</p>
  <p>Starting in 7th grade I wanted to get into Harvard just like my brother. After 10th grade at Staples High School I transferred to Kent School for hockey. In 12th grade I became a Siemens Competition Finalist. I got in to Harvard early action.</p>
  <p>I became interested in app development, psychology, personal development, health, nutrition, yoga, meditation, and more. I graduated with a degree in computer science and went on to help build Venmo.</p>
  <p>After that I volunteered at Kripalu, invested my savings, and became a licensed massage therapist.</p>
  <p>Now I'm taking time off, practicing self-care, and getting organized.</p>
