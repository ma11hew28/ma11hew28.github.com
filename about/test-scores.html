  <h1>Test scores</h1>
  <p>I got these test scores during my last three years of high school. I had trouble finishing timed tests on time, so I got an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis to get extended time. I had time and a half on I think all of these tests except for AP European History and SAT II Physics, both of which I took at Kent School at the end of 10th grade. After high school I took a few lessons with a speed reading tutor. Maybe those lessons helped because I think I'm faster now at finishing timed tests, but I'm probably still slower than most people.</p>
