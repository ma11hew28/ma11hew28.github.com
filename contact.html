  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>I'm not looking for a job. But if you were to offer me $7 million a year to work on something important for 35 hours/week with 3 weeks/year of paid vacation, then I might be interested.</p>
  <p>If you have tech-support questions, I suggest googling them. If you have programming questions, I suggest asking them on Stack Overflow. If you still need my help, I charge $6,000/hour.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in networking, socializing, etc, feel free to email me. <code>liveloveprosper</code> is the local-part of my email, and <code>gmail.com</code> is the domain. That's also my email for PayPal & Venmo.</p>
